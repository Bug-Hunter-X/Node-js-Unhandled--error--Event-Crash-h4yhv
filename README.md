This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled 'error' events leading to server crashes.  The `serverBug.js` file contains the problematic code, which lacks proper error handling.  The solution, provided in `serverSolution.js`, shows how to implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.  This is crucial for creating stable and reliable Node.js applications.
